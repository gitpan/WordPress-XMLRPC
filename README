WordPress::XMLRPC

$Revision: 1.1.1.1 $


TESTING
=======


To test fully, you need to set up a ./t/wppost YAML


t/wppost
--------

This is a YAML file,  file should contain:

   ---
   U:username
   P:password
   p:proxy

Example t/wppost file:

   ---
   U: jim
   P: wegjwgw
   p: 'http://jim/xmlrpc.php'

When you run this on a proxy for a wordpress blog with content, 
you're gonna get all kinds of output. 
The calls do not provide arguments, so some calls will fail.

I suggest you pipe the output (STDERR) to a file.

   perl t/10_XMLRPC.t 2> t/out

Then you can open the file with vim and inspect the output.
This may be useful to get acquainted with what's going on on the inside.

Example output is in t/10_XMLRPC.out

INSTALLATION
============

perl Makefile.PL
make test
make install
