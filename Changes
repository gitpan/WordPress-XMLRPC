	* lib/WordPress/XMLRPC.pm, t/12_categories.t: added getCategory(),
	  this was philosophically hard.. because there was no getCategory
	  method in xmlrpc.php ... but it is very useful.

	* lib/WordPress/XMLRPC.pm, t/11_category_new.t: Fixed newCategory
	  It was suggesting argument is string but it should have  been
	  hash ref, now checks that the hash ref contains at least 'name'
	  key.

	* lib/WordPress/XMLRPC.pm: Added extra argument checking, now if
	  you pass a scalar or hash instead of a hash ref when needed, we
	  croak about it.  Someone contacted me trying to pass a hash
	  instead of a hash ref to newPost().

	* lib/WordPress/XMLRPC.pm, t/11_category_new.t, t/12_categories.t:

	  bug.
